#!!
- FIX REDIRECT ON SUBMIT BUTTON - FIXED
- FIND OUT WHY SUBMIT WITH JS IS BREAKING


# FEATURES TO COMPLETE
- JS -> NEXT BLOCK - DONE
- END OF ROUTE / VIEW PAGES  - DONE
- MODELS, INCLUDEING CALLING MODEL FUNCTIONS IN CONTROLLER - DONE
- ERROR HANDLEING
- - PHP - FORM ERROR DONE, CAN NOW RAISE REDIRECT IN ROUTE HANDLER
- - JS CONTROLLER ERROR HANDLEING - FORM ERRORS DONE VIA PHP, JUST REDIRECT BRO, LMAO
- SHOW PROPER ERROR 
- SANITISE ALL USER INPUTS
- STAMP IN ROUTE INFORMATION INTO DB, INCLUDEING ROUTE CALLED, INPUT AND OUTPUT AT EACH BLOCK, ETC.
- PROOF OF CONCEPT CRUD APP AS A TEST
- DEVELOPER DOCS
- BASIC CSS TEMPLATE, DESING TO BE NICE AND EASY TO USE SO A DEV COULD JUST MODIFIY THE DEFAULT CSS MORE MOST PROJECTS AND STILL GET GOOD RESULTS 


# POSIBLE EXTRAS
- API CALLS(THIS IS AN EXTRA AS WE COULD JUST MAKE THIS AS PART OF THE CONTROLLER)
- DB MIGRATIONS AS SEEN IN LARAVEL
- AUTO FORM BUILDER BASED ON TEMPLATES, DEFINE A DB LAYOUT AND THEN RUNNING THE COMMAND WILL CREATE BASIC CRUD PAGES FOR THE DEVELOPER





# AREAS TO FIX
- ENDING A ROUTE ON A JS CONTROLLER WILL CAUSE THE ROUTE TO END WITH A JS ERROR(AS THE END_ROUTE COMMAND IS NOT SENT)


# AREAS TO DOCUMENT
- THE FILE STRUCTURE 
- SETTING UP THE PROJECT(URLs)
- DB SETUP(CONIDER MAKING THIS AN ENV FILE)
- CREATING CONTROLLER AND FUNCTIONS
- CRETING MODEL AND FUNCTIONS
- - INSERT
- - UPDATE
- - SELECT

- JS CONTROLLERS
- DEFANITION
- HOOKING ONTO PAGE
