# Excalibur CRUD Demo
This is a example project using the Excalibur framework, using this project and the Excalibur Docs(Coming soon) this project you should have a good idea of how to build a website with the framework.

There is no live version of this project as hosting a live, public facing website seems like a bad idea.

#Techstack of this project
- Excalibur
- Tailwind

# Before Using
This framework is currently a heavy work in progress and is at the stage of technical demo, there are still planned security features missing from the current framework so please do not use on a public facing server without assessing the risks yourself.
